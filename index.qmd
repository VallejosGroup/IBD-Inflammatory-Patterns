## About

This website presents the analytical reports developed for
*Characterising heterogeneity in inflammatory bowel disease via routinely collected inflammatory longitudinal biomarker profiles in the Lothian IBD Registry*
by Constantine-Cooke et al. In this work, we expand upon our previous research
which clustered faecal calprotectin profiles for a subset of Crohn's disease
patients [@constantine-cooke2023]. This work explores clustering faecal
calprotectin and CRP profiles across all IBD patients treated by the NHS Lothian
health board. 

This analysis is designed to be run either inside or outside of a Docker
container. File paths will be adjusted based on the detected environment. 

The analysis pipeline for this project consists of two stages:

1. [Preprocessing](source/preprocessing/preprocessing.qmd) where data obtained from clinicians are
   reformatted and any data quality issues are dealt with.
2. Model selection, where latent class mixed models are fitted with differing
   numbers of assumed clusters and the most appropriate model is selected.
   Separate reports are generated for
   [faecal calprotectin](source/selection/fcal.qmd) and
   [CRP](source/selection/crp.qmd).
   
## Using this website

The navigation menu at the top of the page will allow you to navigate through
the steps of the analysis pipeline.  The code button at the top of each page can
be used to show all code blocks instead of clicking on the code buttons for each
individual block of code. Moving the mouse pointer over any citations in a
report will produce a pop up box with reference details. Clicking on the
citation will link to the bibliography at the bottom of the page. 

## Software versions

All analyses have been generated using
[`r strsplit(R.version$version.string, " (", fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1]`](https://www.r-project.org).

See the Session Information sections at the bottom of each report to see the R
packages used for that particular report and respective versions.
