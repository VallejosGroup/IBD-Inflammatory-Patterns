## About

This website presents the analyses carried out for
*Large-scale clustering of longitudinal faecal calprotectin and CRP profiles in inflammatory bowel disease*
by Constantine-Cooke et al. In this work, we expand upon our previous research
which clustered faecal calprotectin profiles for a subset of Crohn's disease
patients [@constantine-cooke2023] by clustering faecal
calprotectin (FC) and CRP profiles across all both Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis patients treated by the NHS Lothian health board. 

This analysis is designed to be run either inside or outside of a Docker
container. File paths will be adjusted based on the detected environment. 

The analysis pipeline for this project consists of three stages:

1. [Preprocessing](source/preprocessing/preprocessing.qmd) where data obtained from clinicians are
   reformatted and any data quality issues are dealt with.
2. Model selection, where latent class mixed models are fitted with differing
   numbers of assumed clusters and the most appropriate model is selected.
   Separate pages are available for
   [faecal calprotectin](source/selection/fcal.qmd) and
   [CRP](source/selection/crp.qmd).
3. Post hoc analyses.
   
## Using this website

The navigation menu at the top of the page will allow you to navigate through
the steps of the analysis pipeline.  The code button at the top of each page can
be used to show all code blocks instead of clicking on the code buttons for each
individual block of code. Moving the mouse pointer over any citations will
produce a pop up box with reference details. Clicking on the citation will link
to the bibliography at the bottom of the page. 

## Software

All analyses have been generated using
[`r strsplit(R.version$version.string, " (", fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1]`](https://www.r-project.org).

Please see the *Session Information* sections at the end of each page for the
R packages and the respective versions used. 

This website has been generated using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
scientific publishing system built on top of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org). A
