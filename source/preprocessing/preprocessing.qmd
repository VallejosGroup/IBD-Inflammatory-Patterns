This page details preprocessing steps undertaken prior to model fitting.
These steps include examining data quality, performing data cleaning, and
deriving the study cohort. 

The data used in this pipeline have been primarily obtained from TRAK, a system
used by NHS Lothian for the electronic ordering of laboratory tests. However, we
also use additional data which have been manually curated by the Lees group for
previous studies (see @Jenkinson2020).

Prior to this report, all subject CHI (community health index) numbers, which 
uniquely identifies a patient when they interact with NHS Scotland services, 
were pseudoanonymised. Each CHI has been replaced with a unique random number. 

### Inclusion/exclusion criteria definitions

The inclusion criteria for this study can broadly be categorised into two
classifications: baseline and longitudinal. Baseline criteria can be applied
using information known at diagnosis whilst longitudinal criteria are based on 
biomarker measurements taken over time.

The longitudinal criteria for each biomarker (FCAL and CRP) are considered
independently. If a subject meets the below criteria for FCAL but not CRP, then
only the FCAL for the subject will be modelled and vice versa. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Baseline 

##### Diagnosis of Inflammatory bowel disease

As inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the disease of interest for this study,
subjects are required to have a confirmed diagnosis of either Crohn's disease,
ulcerative colitis, or inflammatory bowel disease unclassified. 

##### Diagnosis date

Study subjects are required to have been diagnosed with IBD between October 2004
and December 2017. The lower bound is required as FCAL tests were not introduced
until 2005 and we require study subjects to have a FCAL available close to
diagnosis (see the longitudinal tab). The upper bound is required to ensure
subjects have the opportunity to have at least five years of follow-up. The most
recent FCAL observation in this dataset is January 2023 which informed when
deciding upon this cut-off.

#### Longitudinal

##### Diagnostic measurement

We require study subjects to have a biomarker measurement taken ±90 days of
reported date of diagnosis. 

##### At least three non-censored measurements

To ensure stability and interpretability, study subjects are also required to
have at three non-censored biomarker measurements taken across follow-up. Like
most biomarkers, the biomarkers used in this study are subject to censoring.
However, these censored observations make it impossible to detect changes over
time and we therefore do not wish to be reliant on censored observations. 

:::

### Datasets

```{R Read files}
if (file.exists("/.dockerenv")) { # Check if running in Docker
  # Assume igmm/Vallejo-predict/libdr/ is passed to the data volume
  prefix <- "data/"
} else {
  # Assume running outside of a Docker container and the IGC(/IGMM) datastore is
  # mounted at /Volumes
  prefix <- "/Volumes/igmm/cvallejo-predicct/libdr/"
}

fcal <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2022-12-07/fcal-cleaned.csv"))

# Extract from TRAK which also now introduces CRP.
labs <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2023-02-15/labs.csv"))
labs.fcal <- subset(labs, TEST == "f-Calprotectin-ALP")
# labs prefix not required for crp as labs is the only crp extract
crp <- subset(labs, TEST == "C-Reactive Prot")
updated <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2023-03-13/allPatientsNathanCleaned.csv"))
outcomes <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2022-12-07/cd-cleaned.csv"))
```

Multiple datasets are used in this report with varying degrees of previous
curation.

* `labs.csv` is a January 2023 extraction from TRAK describing
  `r nrow(labs)` test results (FCAL: `r nrow(labs.fcal)`; CRP:
  `r nrow(crp)`). Each row represents a test result with columns indicating the
  corresponding subject ID, the test type (FCAL or CRP), the time of the test,
  and the test result. This dataset contains the most recent data out of the
  other datasets. However, there has been no manual curation of these data, and
  no information about the patient's  characteristics are available (other than
  their ID). 
* `fcal-cleaned.csv` does not describe CRP data. However, these data have been 
  curated by the Lees group (primarily by **ML**) and includes additional FCAL
  results. These are likely from other studies which involved FCAL data, such
  as [PREdiCCt](https://www.predicct.co.uk). In addition to `r nrow(fcal)`
  FCAL test results, each row also provides the sex, IBD type, date of
  diagnosis, and date of death (if applicable) for the corresponding subject. 
* `allPatientsNathanCleaned.csv` provides sex, IBD type, and diagnosis date for
  most (but not all) subjects in `labs.csv` not described by `fcal-cleaned.csv`. 
* `cd-cleaned.csv`, curated and maintained by **PWJ**, describes CD patient
  data (n = `r nrow(outcomes)`). In addition to the same basic patient
  characteristic variables in other datasets, this dataset also describes
  surgical outcomes and biologic treatments prescribed to the subject. 
  
::: {.callout-note}
The "cleaned" in the above file names refers to the CHI numbers having been
replaced. No further processing of the data has been undertaken for this study
prior to the steps outlined in this report.

## Subject data

We will create a "dictionary" which, for each subject, lists their subject ID,
their IBD type, and their date of diagnosis. In addition to ensuring inclusion
criteria are met, date of diagnosis will be used to retime all biomarker
measurements of a subject such that $t=0$ corresponds to their diagnosis date.
IBD types are used to test if clusters are enriched by IBD type and may be used
to adjust the clustering. 

There are multiple potential sources for date of diagnosis and IBD type: the
CD outcomes dataset (maintained by **PWJ**), a demographics dataset maintained
by the Lees group, and a raw TRAK extraction. For every subject listed in at 
least one of these datasets, we have tried to extract their date of diagnosis
and diagnosis type. We have assumed a hierarchy of datasets where manually
curated datasets are preferred for extracting data over a dataset generated with
minimal human involvement. 

```{R Create subject dictionary}
ids <- unique(c(outcomes$ids, fcal$ids, updated$ids))
diagnosis <- character()
date.of.diag <- character()
for (id in ids) {
  if (id %in% outcomes$ids) {
    # Outcomes data only contains CD subjects
    diagnosis <- c(diagnosis, "Crohn's Disease")
    date.of.diag <- c(
      date.of.diag,
      subset(outcomes, ids == id)$diagnosisDate
    )
  } else if (id %in% updated$ids) {
    diagnosis <- c(diagnosis, subset(updated, ids == id)[1, "diagnosis"])
    date.of.diag <- c(
      date.of.diag,
      subset(updated, ids == id)[1, "diagnosisDate"]
    )
  } else if (id %in% fcal$ids) {
    diagnosis <- c(diagnosis, subset(fcal, ids == id)[1, "diagnosis"])
    date.of.diag <- c(
      date.of.diag,
      subset(fcal, ids == id)[1, "diagnosis_date"]
    )
  } else {
    diagnosis <- c(diagnosis, "Unknown")
    date.of.diag <- c(
      date.of.diag,
      "Unknown"
    )
  }
}

dict <- data.frame(
  ids = ids,
  diagnosis = diagnosis,
  date.of.diag = fix_date_char(date.of.diag)
)

rm(id, ids, diagnosis, date.of.diag) # clean up
dict <- fix_date_df(dict, "date.of.diag")
```

```{R}
dict <- fcal[,c("ids", "sex")] %>%
  distinct(ids,
           .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  merge(x = dict, by = "ids", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)


# Update NA sex if sex available from updated

dict <- merge(dict,
              updated[, c("ids", "sex")],
              by = "ids",
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE) 

for (i in 1:nrow(dict)){
  if (is.na(dict[i, "sex.x"]) & !is.na(dict[i, "sex.y"])) {
    dict[i, "sex.x"] <- dict[i, "sex.y"]
  }
}

dict$sex <- dict$sex.x
dict$sex.x <- dict$sex.y <- NULL

# Add age at IBD diagnosis
updated <- fix_date_df(updated, "diagnosisDate")
updated$age <- with(updated, year(diagnosisDate) - dateOfBirth)
dict <- merge(dict,
              updated[, c("ids", "age")],
              by = "ids",
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE)
```


There are a total of `r nrow(dict)` subjects in our dictionary before filtering
by inclusion/exclusion criteria. `r sum(is.na(dict$date.of.diag))` subjects had
an `NA` date of diagnosis and will be removed
(resulting in `r nrow(dict) - sum(is.na(dict$date.of.diag))` subjects)

```{R Remove NA date of diagnosis}
dict <- dict[!is.na(dict$date.of.diag), ]
```


### Diagnosis type

As can be seen in the below frequency table, two spellings of Crohn's disease 
(with and without an apostrophe) and three names for IBDU are being used. There
is also a subject reported to not have IBD. 

```{R Frequency table to diagnosis pre-process}
#| label: tbl-diag-pre
#| tbl-cap: Frequency table of reported IBD type
kable(table(dict$diagnosis, useNA = "always"),
  col.names = c("Variable", "Frequency")
)
``` 

The Crohn's disease and IBDU names have been standardised (IBDU,
Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Unknown Subtype are
assumed to be equivalent). The subject reported to not have IBD has been
removed. 

```{R Contingency table of IBD diagnosis pre and post processing}
#| label: tbl-diag-post
#| tbl-cap: Contingency table showing mapping of IBD types to a standardised format
#| results: "hold"
dict$old <- dict$diagnosis
dict$diagnosis <- plyr::mapvalues(
  dict$diagnosis,
  from = c(
    "Crohns Disease",
    "Inflamatory Bowel Disease",
    "Inflamatory Bowel Disease - Unknown Subtype"
  ),
  to = c(
    "Crohn's Disease",
    "IBDU",
    "IBDU"
  )
)
dict <- subset(dict, diagnosis != "Not IBD")


kable(addmargins(table(dict$diagnosis, dict$old), margin = 2))
dict$old <- NULL
```


### Date of diagnosis

Date of diagnosis in an integral aspect of the inclusion criteria and also used
to retime biomarker measurements. 

#### Applying exclusion criteria 

```{R Apply date of diagnosis exclusion}
# no. subjects over upper bound
n.upper <- nrow(subset(dict, year(date.of.diag) >= 2018))
# no. subjects under lower bound
n.lower <- nrow(subset(dict, (year(date.of.diag) < 2004) |
  (year(date.of.diag) == 2004 & month(date.of.diag) <= 9)))

# subset to subjects meeting the criteria.
dict <- subset(dict, year(date.of.diag) <= 2017)
dict <- subset(dict, (year(date.of.diag) >= 2005) |
  (year(date.of.diag) == 2004 & month(date.of.diag) >= 10))
```

As described in the
[inclusion/exclusion criteria section](#inclusionexclusion-criteria-definitions),
study subjects are required to be diagnosed between October 2004 and December
2017. As such, subjects who do not meet this criteria will be excluded.
`r n.upper` subjects were diagnosed in 2018 or later and were removed, and 
`r n.lower` subjects were diagnosed prior to October 2004 and were likewise
removed. This results in a cohort size of `r nrow(dict)` subjects. 

```{R Clean up excluded date of diagnosis counts}
#| include: false
rm(n.upper, n.lower) # clean up
```

#### Exploration

We now explore date of diagnosis to ensure data quality is at a suitable
standard.

##### Year of diagnosis

From @fig-diag-year, we can see the number of IBD diagnoses each year is
relatively static with the exception of 2004 and 2005. The former describes
only three months of the year, and incidence was likely still increasing across
both of these two years.  @Jones2019 found IBD incidence from 2008 onwards to be
consistent over time for patients diagnosed by NHS Lothian which is in agreement
with our findings.

```{R Year of diagnosis}
#| label: fig-diag-year
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of year of diagnosis"
dict %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year(date.of.diag))) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#B8F2E6", color = "black", binwidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year of IBD diagnosis") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

##### Month of diagnosis

It appears there are subjects for whom only year of diagnosis was available.
This has resulted in the 1<sup>st</sup> of January for that year being
recorded as the date of diagnosis for that subject. As such, far more diagnoses
are reported in January than in other months (@fig-diag-month). There are
`r sum(day(dict$date.of.diag) == 1 & month(dict$date.of.diag) == 1)`
subjects reported to have been diagnosed on New Year's day .

If a subject's exact date of diagnosis is not known, then this is most likely
because the subject was not diagnosed by NHS Lothian. Instead, the date of
diagnosis would have needed to be recalled by the subject which introduces the
inaccuracy observed.

As subjects are require a diagnostic biomarker measurement to be available
within 90 days of reported date of diagnosis to be included in this study and
patients diagnosed outside of NHS Lothian will not have a biomarker test result
available within this period, the effect on  our study should be minimal.
However, we will revisit month of diagnosis after filtering by existence of
diagnostic biomarker measurements to confirm our assumption. 

```{R Month of diagnosis (preprocessed)}
#| label: fig-diag-month
#| fig-cap: "Bar plot of month of diagnosis"
dict %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(month(date.of.diag, label = TRUE)))) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "#FEC601", linewidth = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Month of IBD Diagnosis")
```

## Faecal calprotectin

Faecal calprotectin (FCAL), a marker of intestinal inflammation, has been
obtained from two datasets. The first dataset has been curated by members of the
Lees group whilst the second dataset is a direct extract from TRAK, a patient
monitoring system used by NHS Lothian. 

### Incorporating later extract

Data from these datasets has been merged and duplicates of data (same
subject ID, measurement date, and recorded value) were removed. We also
reduced the FCAL dataset to only describe subjects for whom IBD type and date of
diagnosis are available for.

For the TRAK extract, times for test results are given in datetime format (where
both date and time of the day are provided). The times have been dropped as this
degree of granularity is not required.

```{R FCAL merge}
fcal <- fcal[, c("ids", "calpro_date", "calpro_result")]
labs.fcal <- labs.fcal[, c("CHI", "COLLECTION_DATE", "TEST_DATA")] %>%
  subset(CHI %in% dict$ids)

# Collection dates include collection times which are not required. Discarding.
labs.fcal$COLLECTION_DATE <- fix_date_char(
  stringr::str_split_fixed(labs.fcal$COLLECTION_DATE, " ", n = 2)[, 1]
)
colnames(labs.fcal) <- c("ids", "calpro_date", "calpro_result")
fcal <- rbind(fcal, labs.fcal)
fcal <- fix_date_df(fcal, "calpro_date")
fcal <- fcal %>% distinct(ids,
  calpro_date,
  calpro_result,
  .keep_all = TRUE
)
fcal <- subset(fcal, ids %in% dict$ids)
fcal <- merge(fcal,
              dict[, c("ids", "diagnosis", "sex", "age")],
              by = "ids",
              all.x = TRUE)
```

### Test results

FCAL data can be both left and right censored. FCAL recorded as "<20" were
mapped to "20". FCAL recorded as ">1250", ">2500", or ">6000" were all mapped to
"1250". Any FCAL tests given an error code by the laboratory have been removed. 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### More information on FCAL censoring

The lower limit of detection is
$<20 \mu g/g$ ($20 \mu g$ of calprotectin per $g$ of stool). By reducing the
upper limit, it is possible to run more tests in parallel. As a higher
throughput has been required over time, the upper threshold for tests has
become lower. Initially test results over $6000 \mu g/g$ were censored, then
$2500 \mu g/g$ and now $1250 \mu g /g$ is the upper limit for FCAL tests.  This
change has resulted in minimal impact in clinics as $1250 \mu g/g$ is still
considered a high FCAL result. However, this change has potential
implications for research. 
::: 

```{R FCAL censor mapping}
#| label: "fig-fcal-meas"
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of FCAL measurements by observed value"
#| warning: false
fcal$calpro_result <- plyr::mapvalues(
  fcal$calpro_result,
  from = c(
    "<20",
    ">1250",
    ">2500",
    ">6000"
  ),
  to = c(
    "20",
    "1250",
    "2500",
    "2500"
  )
)

temp <- fcal[is.na(as.numeric(fcal[, "calpro_result"])), ]

fcal$calpro_result <- as.numeric(fcal$calpro_result) # Remove error codes
fcal <- fcal[!is.na(fcal[, "calpro_result"]), ]

fcal[fcal[, "calpro_result"] > 1250, "calpro_result"] <- 1250
fcal$calpro_result <- as.numeric(fcal$calpro_result)

fcal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = calpro_result)) +
  geom_density(
    linewidth = 0.8,
    alpha = 0.5,
    fill = "#9FD8CB",
    color = "#517664"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("FCAL (µg/g)") +
  ylab("Density")
```

FCAL test results on the original measurement scale are heavily right-skewed
towards $100 \mu g/g$. These data will be log
transformed- resulting in the multi-modal distribution seen in @fig-logfcal-meas. 

```{R}
#| label: "fig-logfcal-meas"
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of logged FCAL test results"
fcal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(calpro_result))) +
  geom_density(
    linewidth = 0.8,
    alpha = 0.5,
    fill = "#9FD8CB",
    color = "#517664"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("log(FCAL (µg/g))") +
  ylab("Density")
```

### Observations per subject

Although we explore the number of observations per subject in this section, we
will not yet apply the inclusion criteria of having at least three FCAL
measurements. This is because
[we later](#at-least-three-measurements-maximum-followup) reduce the maximum
follow-up which will impact the number of observations per subject. 

The number of FCAL measurements per subject is right-skewed (@fig-fcal-dist).
However, there are also subjects with many FCAL observations. These subjects
were investigated and found to often have a complex disease course, such as
acute severe ulcerative colitis, and required close monitoring as a result. 

```{R Number of FCAL observations per subject}
#| label: fig-fcal-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of number of FCAL measurements per subject. The red line indicates the required minimum number of observations for inclusion"

FCcounts <- as.vector(table(fcal$ids))
FCcountsdf <- tibble(ids = names(table(fcal$ids)), counts = FCcounts)
FCcountsdf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#887C9B") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5, color = "#D80032") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Number of FCAL observations per subject") +
  ylab("Count")
```

### Retiming 

Time of FCAL measurements were retimed and scaled to be the number of years
since IBD diagnosis.

```{R FCAL time mapping}
#| label: fig-fcal-spag-pre
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plot of FCAL trajectories (preprocessed)"

diagnosis_date <- as.Date(NULL)
for (i in 1:nrow(fcal)) {
  diagnosis_date <- c(
    diagnosis_date,
    subset(dict, ids == fcal[i, "ids"])$date.of.diag
  )
}

# Dates have already been converted to Date class by fix_date_char() for dict
fcal$calpro_time <- as.numeric(fcal$calpro_date - diagnosis_date) / 365.25
rm(i, diagnosis_date) # Tidy up

fcal <- fcal[!is.na(fcal[, "calpro_time"]), ]

fcal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = calpro_time, y = log(calpro_result), color = factor(ids))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(length(unique(fcal$ids)))) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log(FCAL (µg/g))") +
  ggtitle("")
```

After retiming, it is clear some FCAL observations are earlier than diagnosis
and in some cases substantially earlier (@fig-fcal-spag-pre). Tests taken
close to reported date of diagnosis are likely "early" as a result of diagnostic
delay whereas tests from much earlier were likely requested due to other
conditions. 

As such, FCAL results earlier than 90 days prior to diagnosis will be discarded.
If a subject has an FCAL within 90 days before diagnosis, then all of their
FCAL tests will be retimed such that their earliest FCAL within this period is 
equal to 0 and all later measurements are shifted accordingly to maintain the 
same differences between measurement times. 

We also reduce the dataset to only subjects with a diagnostic FCAL which equates
to subjects with a FCAL measurement within 3 months of diagnosis $t \leq 0.25$

```{R FCAL retiming}
#| label: fig-fcal-spag-post
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plot of FCAL trajectories (processed)"
fcal <- subset(fcal, calpro_time >= -0.25)


diagnostic <- numeric()
for (id in unique(fcal$ids)) {
  temp <- subset(fcal, ids == id)
  if (any(temp$calpro_time < 0.25)) diagnostic <- c(diagnostic, id)
}

fcal <- subset(fcal, ids %in% diagnostic)

# Retime so that t_0 = 0.
for (id in unique(fcal$ids)) {
  temp <- subset(fcal, ids == id)
  if (any(temp$calpro_time < 0)) {
    add <- sort(temp$calpro_time)[1]
    fcal[fcal[, "ids"] == id, "calpro_time"] <-
      fcal[fcal[, "ids"] == id, "calpro_time"] + abs(add)
  }
}

fcal %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = calpro_time, y = log(calpro_result), color = factor(ids))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(length(unique(fcal$ids)))) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log(FCAL (µg/g))") +
  ggtitle("")
```

There are `r length(diagnostic)` subjects with a diagnostic FCAL available. 

### Minimum followup

We do not require a minimum follow-up for a subject as this may bias our
findings. For example, UC patients who undergo a proctocolectomy (surgical
removal of the colon and rectum) are less likely to have FCAL measurements after
their surgery than patients who did not require surgery. By applying criteria
based on follow-up, we could indirectly exclude subjects based on disease
outcomes. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-fcal-follow-up
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of FCAL follow-up per subject"
tab <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 0)
colnames(tab) <- c("ids", "Followup")
for (id in unique(fcal$ids)) {
  followup <- max(subset(fcal, ids == id)$calpro_time)
  tab <- rbind(tab, c(id, followup))
}

tab <- as.data.frame(tab)

tab |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Followup)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "#5BBA6F", binwidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Followup (years)")
```

We have also plotted number of FCAL measurements for each subject against their
follow-up to explore the relationship between these two attributes (@fig-n-fcal).

```{R}
#| label: fig-n-fcal
#| fig-cap: "Number of FCAL measurements against follow-up for each subject"
tab.temp <- tab
hmm <- data.frame(
  ids = names(table(fcal$ids)),
  n = as.vector(table(fcal$ids))
)
tab.temp <- merge(tab.temp, hmm, by = "ids")
tab.temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = n, x = Followup)) +
  geom_point(color = "#FF4F79", size = 2) +
  ylab("Number of FCAL measurements") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Measurement frequency

```{R FCAL frequency}
fcal <- subset(
  fcal,
  ids %in% as.numeric(
    names(
      table(fcal$ids)[table(fcal$ids) >= 3]
    )
  )
)
```

We require a subject has at least three FCAL measurements across the follow-up
period to meet our inclusion criteria.

There are `r length(unique(fcal$ids))` subjects who have at least three FCAL 
measurements available (before
[reducing the maximum followup](#maximum-followup)).

### Maximum followup 

A maximum follow-up should be specified in the interest of constructing robust
models which are not heavily influenced by observations at the end of follow-up
where observations are more sparse. We also ensure a subject is only included if
they have at least three FCAL measurements during the restricted follow-up. 

The decision for a specific cut-off is based upon two tables. @tbl-follow-up
explores how increasing the follow-up changes the mean, median, and interquartile
range of the number of observations per subject. @tbl-count-fcal investigates
how many subjects have at least one FCAL after a set threshold. 

```{R}
#| label: tbl-follow-up
#| tbl-cap: Statistics for number of observations across a range of maximum follow-up
years <- seq(1, 15, by = 1)
mean.n <- c()
median.n <- c()
IQR.n <- c()
freq <- c()

for (year in years) {
  # restrict to measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(fcal, calpro_time <= year)
  # restrict to subjects with at least three measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(temp, ids %in% as.numeric(names(table(temp$ids)[table(temp$ids) >= 3])))
  counts <- table(temp$ids)
  mean.n <- c(mean.n, round(mean(counts), 2))
  median.n <- c(median.n, median(counts))
  IQR.n <- c(IQR.n, IQR(counts))
  freq <- c(freq, length(names(counts)))
}

knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    years = years,
    freq = freq,
    mean.n = mean.n,
    median.n = median.n,
    IQR.n = IQR.n
  )[5:15, ],
  col.names = c(
    "Year cut-off",
    "Number of subjects",
    "Mean",
    "Median",
    "IQR"
  )
)
```

```{R}
#| label: tbl-count-fcal
#| tbl-cap: "How many subjects have an FCAL available after a given number of years?"
count <- numeric()
for (year in years) {
  count <- c(count, length(unique(subset(fcal, calpro_time > year)$ids)))
}

count.tab <- data.frame(
  years = years,
  count = count
)
kable(count.tab, col.names = c("Years", "Number of subjects"))
```

From the above table, ten years of maximum follow-up appears to be the most 
appropriate. However, we instead elect to use seven years of maximum follow-up
in order to [be consistent with CRP](#maximum-followup-1)


```{R}
fcal <- subset(fcal, calpro_time <= 7)
# restrict to subjects with at least three measurements within threshold
fcal <- subset(
  fcal,
  ids %in% as.numeric(
    names(
      table(fcal$ids)[table(fcal$ids) >= 3]
    )
  )
)
```


### Censored observations

```{R Generate FCAL counts}
id.vector <- numeric()
count <- numeric()
censored.left <- numeric()
censored.right <- numeric()

for (id in unique(fcal$ids)) {
  fcal.subject <- subset(fcal, ids == id)
  id.vector <- c(id.vector, id)
  count <- c(count, nrow(fcal.subject))
  censored.left <- c(censored.left, sum(fcal.subject$calpro_result == 20))
  censored.right <- c(censored.right, sum(fcal.subject$calpro_result == 1250))
}

countsDF <- tibble(
  ids = id.vector,
  count = count,
  censored.left = censored.left,
  censored.right = censored.right
)
```

We now explore censored FCAL observations and begin by considering FCAL results
which have been left-censored ($\leq 20 \mu g/g$). From @fig-left-censor-fcal,
we can clearly see there are subjects with entirely left-censored FCAL
observations (n = `r nrow(subset(countsDF, censored.left/count ==1))`). 

```{R}
#| label: fig-left-censor-fcal
#| fig-cap: "Left-censored observations per subject"
#  Hold results for no. of measurements and no. of censored obs per subject
countsDF %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = censored.left / count, y = count)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.9, color = "#70A288") +
  ylab("Total number of observations") +
  xlab("Proportion of left-censored observations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Looking at right-censored observations (@fig-right-censor-fcal), we see there
are fewer subjects with a high proportion (>50%  of censored observations).
Nevertheless, there are still subjects with only right censored observations 
(n = `r nrow(subset(countsDF, censored.right/count ==1))`). 

```{R}
#| label: fig-right-censor-fcal
#| fig-cap: "Right-censored observations per subject"
countsDF %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = censored.right / count, # Proportion censored
    y = count
  )) + # Total censored
  # Add jitter to better show distribution
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 0.9, color = "#D5896F") +
  ylab("Total number of observations") +
  xlab("Proportion of right-censored observations") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```


In line with our inclusion criteria, we exclude subjects with fewer than three
non-censored observations.

```{R}
keep <- countsDF[with(countsDF, count - (censored.left + censored.right) >= 3), ]
fcal <- subset(fcal, ids %in% keep$ids)
```

This results in a cohort size of `r length(unique(fcal$ids))`
(`r nrow(countsDF) - nrow(keep)` subjects removed).

### Revisiting month of diagnosis

After filtering by subjects who have a diagnostic FCAL available, January is
no longer over-represented for month of diagnosis as we hypothesised
(@fig-diag-month-redux)

```{R Month of diagnosis (postprocessed)}
#| label: fig-diag-month-redux
#| fig-cap: "Bar plot of month of diagnosis"
dict.temp <- subset(dict, ids %in% unique(fcal$ids))
dict.temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(month(date.of.diag, label = TRUE)))) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "#FEC601", linewidth = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Month of IBD Diagnosis")
```

## C-reactive protein

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood-based marker of inflammation. Unlike FCAL,
which is highly specific to gastrointestinal inflammation, CRP levels are
indicative of overall inflammation and are more likely to be affected by
extra-intestinal factors such as infections. However, patient adherence to CRP
testing is very strong, and CRP has seen historic usage in the field of IBD.
Although CRP has been used for many years, we unfortunately only have test
results from as early as 2008 due to the transition towards using TRAK for
storing CRP results instead of the previous system. 

As there is only one extract for CRP data (obtained from TRAK), merging multiple
datasets is not required. As with the FCAL data, the recorded time of day for 
each test has been discarded in favour of the date. Any potential duplicate
results have been removed.


```{R crp preprocess}
crp <- crp[, c("CHI", "COLLECTION_DATE", "TEST_DATA")] %>%
  subset(CHI %in% dict$ids)

# Collection dates include collection times which are not required. Discarding.
crp$COLLECTION_DATE <- readr::parse_date(
  stringr::str_split_fixed(crp$COLLECTION_DATE, " ", n = 2)[, 1],
  format = "%d-%b-%Y"
)

colnames(crp) <- c("ids", "crp_date", "crp_result")

crp <- merge(crp,
             dict[, c("ids", "diagnosis", "sex", "age")],
             by = "ids",
             all.x = TRUE)
# Remove potential duplicates
crp <- crp %>% distinct(ids,
  crp_date,
  crp_result,
  .keep_all = TRUE
)
```

### Test results

CRP is left-censored, but does not appear to be right-censored. Multiple
cut-offs are reported
(`r unique(as.numeric(gsub("<", "", names(table(crp$crp_result))[2:8])))`)
with there also being variations for how  $< 1mg/L$ is reported
(`r names(table(crp$crp_result))[3:5]`). We map every observation $< 1$ to 1
and map <2, <3, and < 5 to 2, 3, and 5 respectively. Any failed tests (e.g 
due to contamination or an insufficient sample being provided) are discarded.

```{R crp censor mapping}
#| label: "fig-crp-meas"
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of FCAL measurements by observed value"
#| warning: false


# Remove censoring indicators
crp$crp_result <- as.numeric(
  plyr::mapvalues(
    crp$crp_result,
    from = c("<0.2", "<1", "<1.", "<1.0", "<2", "<3", "<5"),
    to = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
  )
)

crp <- crp %>%
  mutate(crp_result = if_else(crp_result < 1, 1, crp_result))

# Remove error test results
crp <- crp[!is.na(crp[, "crp_result"]), ]
# Map numerical <1 test results (e.g 0.2) to 1.

crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_result)) +
  geom_density(
    linewidth = 0.8,
    alpha = 0.5,
    fill = "#FFC800",
    color = "#FF8427"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("CRP (mg/L)") +
  ylab("Density")
```

As can be seen in @fig-crp-meas, extremely elevated CRP has been observed in
some cases. These observations are physiologically valid. However, these data
may skew our models and may be candidates for removal.  

As with the FCAL data, the CRP data is also log transformed (@fig-logcrp-meas). 

```{R}
#| label: "fig-logcrp-meas"
#| fig-cap: "Density plot of logged CRP test results"

crp$crp_result <- log(crp$crp_result)

crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_result)) +
  geom_density(
    linewidth = 0.8,
    alpha = 0.5,
    fill = "#FFC800",
    color = "#FF8427"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  xlab("log(CRP (mg/L))") +
  ylab("Density")
```

Observing @fig-logcrp-meas, it would appear the influence of extremely elevated
CRP results will be minimal. 

### Observations per subject

As with FCAL, we explore the number of observations per subject in this section.
We do not yet apply the inclusion criteria of having at least three CRP
measurements.

```{R Number of CRP observations per subject}
#| label: fig-crp-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of number of CRP measurements per subject. The pink line indicates the required minimum number of observations for inclusion"

CRPcounts <- as.vector(table(crp$ids))
CRPcountsdf <- tibble(counts = CRPcounts)
CRPcountsdf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#0081A7") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5, color = "#FF88DC") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Number of CRP observations per subject") +
  ylab("Count")
```

From @fig-crp-dist, we can see the strong patient adherence to CRP tests
[referred to earlier](#crp). Very few subjects (n = `r sum(CRPcounts < 3)`) have
fewer than three CRP measurements available. 

### Retiming 

As with the FCAL data, the times of CRP measurements are retimed and scaled to
be the number of years since IBD diagnosis.

```{R CRP time mapping}
#| label: fig-crp-spag-pre
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plot of CRP trajectories (preprocessed)"

diagnosis_date <- as.Date(NULL)
for (i in 1:nrow(crp)) {
  diagnosis_date <- c(
    diagnosis_date,
    subset(dict, ids == crp[i, "ids"])$date.of.diag
  )
}

# Dates have already been converted to Date class by fix_date_char() for dict
crp$crp_time <- as.numeric(crp$crp_date - diagnosis_date) / 365.25
rm(i, diagnosis_date) # Tidy up

crp <- crp[!is.na(crp[, "crp_time"]), ]

crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_time, y = crp_result, color = factor(ids))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(length(unique(crp$ids)))) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log(CRP (mg/L))") +
  ggtitle("")
```

As should be expected given the ubiquitous nature of CRP testing, many CRP
observations are earlier than diagnosis (@fig-crp-spag-pre). Tests taken
close to reported date of diagnosis are likely "early" as a result of diagnostic
delay whereas tests from much earlier were likely requested due to other
conditions. 

As with FCAL, CRP results earlier than 90 days prior to diagnosis will be
discarded. If a subject has a CRP within 90 days before diagnosis, then all of
their CRP tests will be retimed such that their earliest CRP within this period
is  equal to 0 and all later measurements are shifted accordingly to maintain
the same differences between measurement times. 

::: {.callout-note}
This may mean $t_0$ corresponds to slightly different dates across FCAL and CRP
for the same subject.
:::

We also reduce the dataset to only subjects with a diagnostic CRP which equates
to subjects with a CRP measurement within 3 months of diagnosis $t \leq 0.25$

```{R CRP retiming}
#| label: fig-crp-spag-post
#| fig-cap: "Spaghetti plot of CRP trajectories (processed)"
crp <- subset(crp, crp_time >= -0.25)

diagnostic <- numeric()
for (id in unique(crp$ids)) {
  temp <- subset(crp, ids == id)
  if (any(temp$crp_time < 0.25)) diagnostic <- c(diagnostic, id)
}

crp <- subset(crp, ids %in% diagnostic)

# Retime so that t_0 = 0.
for (id in unique(crp$ids)) {
  temp <- subset(crp, ids == id)
  if (any(temp$crp_time < 0)) {
    add <- sort(temp$crp_time)[1]
    crp[crp[, "ids"] == id, "crp_time"] <-
      crp[crp[, "ids"] == id, "crp_time"] + abs(add)
  }
}

crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_time, y = crp_result, color = factor(ids))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = viridis::viridis(length(unique(crp$ids)))) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log(CRP (mg/L))") +
  ggtitle("")
```

There are `r length(diagnostic)` subjects with a diagnostic CRP available.

### Minimum followup

As a reminder, we do not require a minimum follow-up for a subject as this may
bias our findings. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-crp-follow-up
#| fig-cap: "Histogram of CRP follow-up per subject"
tab <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 0)
colnames(tab) <- c("ids", "Followup")
for (id in unique(crp$ids)) {
  followup <- max(subset(crp, ids == id)$crp_time)
  tab <- rbind(tab, c(id, followup))
}

tab <- as.data.frame(tab)

tab |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Followup)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "#B38D97", binwidth = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Count") +
  xlab("Followup (years)")
```

We have also plotted number of CRP measurements for each subject against their
follow-up to explore the relationship between these two attributes (@fig-n-crp).

```{R}
#| label: fig-n-crp
#| fig-cap: "Number of CRP measurements against follow-up for each subject"
tab.temp <- tab
hmm <- data.frame(
  ids = names(table(crp$ids)),
  n = as.vector(table(crp$ids))
)
tab.temp <- merge(tab.temp, hmm, by = "ids")
tab.temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = n, x = Followup)) +
  geom_point(color = "#216869", size = 2) +
  ylab("Number of CRP measurements") +
  xlab("Follow-up (years)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Measurement frequency

We require a subject to have at least three CRP measurements across the follow-up
period to meet our inclusion criteria.

```{R CRP frequency}
crp <- subset(
  crp,
  ids %in% as.numeric(
    names(
      table(crp$ids)[table(crp$ids) >= 3]
    )
  )
)
```

There are `r length(unique(crp$ids))` subjects who have at least three CRP 
measurements available (before
[reducing the maximum followup](#maximum-followup-1)).


### Maximum followup 

A maximum follow-up should be specified in the interest of constructing robust
models which are not heavily influenced by observations at the end of follow-up
where observations are more sparse. These two requirements are dependent on one
another as the maximum follow-up affects whether or not a subject has at least
three measurements taken within follow-up. 

As with FCAL, the decision for a specific cut-off is based upon how increasing
follow-up changes the mean, median, and interquartile range of the number of
observations per subject (@tbl-follow-up-crp) and how many subjects have CRP
observations after set thresholds (@tbl-count-crp).

```{R}
#| label: tbl-follow-up-crp
#| tbl-cap: Statistics for number of observations across a range of maximum follow-up
years <- seq(5, 15, by = 1)
mean.n <- c()
median.n <- c()
IQR.n <- c()
freq <- c()

for (year in years) {
  # restrict to measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(crp, crp_time <= year)
  # restrict to subjects with at least three measurements within threshold
  temp <- subset(temp, ids %in% as.numeric(names(table(temp$ids)[table(temp$ids) >= 3])))
  counts <- table(temp$ids)
  mean.n <- c(mean.n, round(mean(counts), 2))
  median.n <- c(median.n, median(counts))
  IQR.n <- c(IQR.n, IQR(counts))
  freq <- c(freq, length(names(counts)))
}

knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    years = years,
    freq = freq,
    mean.n = mean.n,
    median.n = median.n,
    IQR.n = IQR.n
  ),
  col.names = c(
    "Year cut-off",
    "Number of subjects",
    "Mean",
    "Median",
    "IQR"
  )
)
```

```{R}
#| label: tbl-count-crp
#| tbl-cap: "How many subjects have an CRP available after a given number of years?"
years <- seq(1, 15, by = 1)
count <- numeric()
for (year in years) {
  count <- c(count, length(unique(subset(crp, crp_time > year)$ids)))
}

count.tab <- data.frame(years = years, count = count)
kable(count.tab, col.names = c("Years", "Number of subjects"))
```

From the above table, seven years of maximum follow-up appears to be the most 
appropriate. 

```{R}
crp <- subset(crp, crp_time <= 7)
# restrict to subjects with at least three measurements within threshold
crp <- subset(
  crp,
  ids %in% as.numeric(
    names(
      table(crp$ids)[table(crp$ids) >= 3]
    )
  )
)
```

### Additional pre-processing

As can be seen in @fig-crp-sample, the CRP data exhibits substantial noise and
there are many data points which can substantially increase running times when
fitting models. As such, we have taken the step to pre-process the data by
grouping FCAL observations into time intervals for each subject and using the
median where there are multiple observations. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-crp-sample
#| fig-cap: "CRP trajectories for a random sample of 15 subjects"
ids.sample <- sample(unique(crp$ids), 15)
crp.sub <- subset(crp, ids %in% ids.sample)

crp.sub %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_time, y = crp_result, color = factor(ids))) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = colorspace::darken(
    rainbow(15), amount = 0.4)
    ) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("Log(CRP (mg/L))") +
  ggtitle("")
```

```{R}
#| label: fig-crp-sample-ma
#| fig-cap: "CRP trajectories after additional pre-processing for a random sample of 15 subjects"

id.list <- unique(crp$ids)
crp.ma <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(id.list), ncol = 7)

for (i in seq_along(id.list)) {
  subject_data <- subset(crp, ids == id.list[i])
  for (j in seq(0, 6)) {
    if (j == 6) {
      sub.obs <- subset(
        subject_data,
        crp_time >= j - 0.5 & crp_time <= j + 1
      )
    } else {
      sub.obs <- subset(
        subject_data,
        crp_time >= j - 0.5 & crp_time < j + 0.5
      )
    }
    if (nrow(sub.obs) > 0) {
      crp.ma[i, j + 1] <- median(sub.obs$crp_result)
    }
  }
}

rownames(crp.ma) <- id.list

crp.ma  <- crp.ma [rowSums(is.na(crp.ma)) <= 4, ]

id.list <- rownames(crp.ma)

crp.ma <- reshape2::melt(t(crp.ma ), id.vars = row.names(crp.ma ), na.rm = TRUE)
colnames(crp.ma) <- c("crp_time", "ids", "crp_result")
crp.ma  <- crp.ma[, c(2, 3, 1)]


crp.ma$crp_time <- crp.ma$crp_time - 1



# Take into account uneven spacing at start and end
crp.ma$crp_time <- plyr::mapvalues(crp.ma$crp_time,
  from = c(0, 6),
  to = c(0.25, 6.25)
)


# Add diagnosis type back
crp.ma <- merge(crp.ma, dict[, -3], by = "ids", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)


##########################
#--     Plotting       --#
##########################

p <- subset(crp.ma, ids %in% sample(unique(crp.ma$ids), 20)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = crp_time, y = crp_result, color = as.factor(ids))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +

```

It appears from @fig-crp-sample-ma that some subjects have the same median
log-transformed CRP across all of their observations, effectively having a
variance of 0. These subjects will be extracted and considered as their own 
cluster, as they may cause numerical issues when model fitting but remain
of note.

```{R}
var0.ids <- c()
for (id in unique(crp.ma$ids)) {
  temp <- subset(crp.ma, ids == id)
  if (var(temp[, "crp_result"]) == 0) {
    var0.ids <- c(var0.ids, id)
  }
}
```

There are `r length(var0.ids)` subjects with no variation in their preprocessed
CRP observations. Interestingly, these subjects typically exhibit substantial
intra-subject heterogeneity for FC profiles (@fig-FC-sample-crp-var). The CRP
for these subjects will not be modelled via LCMM.

There are `r nrow(crp.ma)` total data points after the additional
preprocessing describing `r length(unique(crp.ma$ids))` subjects. 

```{R}
#| label: tbl-crp-ma-freq
#| tbl-cap: "Quantiles for number of CRP observations per subject after additional preprocessing."
crp.ma %>%
  select(ids) %>%
  table() %>%
  quantile()
```


### Revisiting month of diagnosis

After filtering by subjects who have a diagnostic CRP available, January is
no longer over-represented for month of diagnosis. This is a comparable finding
to FCAL (@fig-diag-month-redux).

```{R Month of diagnosis (postprocessed)}
#| label: fig-diag-month-redux-crp
#| fig-cap: "Bar plot of month of diagnosis"
dict.temp <- subset(dict, ids %in% unique(fcal$ids))
dict.temp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(month(date.of.diag, label = TRUE)))) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", fill = "#FEC601", linewidth = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  xlab("Month of IBD Diagnosis")
```

## Updated density plots

The following plots are updated versions of previous density plots
(@fig-fcal-meas, @fig-logfcal-meas, @fig-crp-meas and @fig-logcrp-meas). These plots only include subjects who have met the inclusion criteria.

## Data saving

The processed subject dictionary and FCAL and CRP datasets have been saved to
files, so they can be used for the primary analysis. 

```{R}
if (!dir.exists(paste0(prefix, "processed"))) {
  dir.create(paste0(prefix, "processed"))
}

fcal$calpro_result <- log(fcal$calpro_result)

saveRDS(dict, paste0(prefix, "processed/dict.RDS"))
saveRDS(fcal, paste0(prefix, "processed/fcal.RDS"))
saveRDS(crp, paste0(prefix, "processed/crp.RDS"))
saveRDS(crp.ma, paste0(prefix, "processed/median-crp.RDS"))
```
