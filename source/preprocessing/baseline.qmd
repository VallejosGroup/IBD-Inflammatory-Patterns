This page provides descriptive analyses of the cohort at baseline, the time of
IBD diagnosis. Following clustering based on FC or CRP trajectories, associations
will be explored between cluster membership and these data. 

As FC and CRP are analysed independently, the data is split into subjects who
met the criteria for FC and CRP analyses. The  colours used in the plot are
specific to either the FC or the CROP cohorts which are also under seperate
tabs. 


## Descriptive analyses

```{R}
fcal <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "processed/fcal.RDS"))
fcal.all <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2022-12-07/fcal-cleaned.csv"))
crp <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "processed/median-crp.RDS"))
dict <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "processed/dict-initial.RDS"))
dict <- dict %>% filter(ids %in% c(fcal$ids, crp$ids)) 
updated <- read.csv(paste0(prefix, "2023-03-13/allPatientsNathanCleaned.csv"))
```

Categorical data is presented via barcharts and frequency tables whilst
continuous data are presented via density plots and quantile tables. Missingness
is not reported if there are no missing data. 

### Age at diagnosis

```{R}
# Add age at IBD diagnosis
updated <- fix_date_df(updated, "diagnosisDate")
updated$age <- with(updated, year(diagnosisDate) - dateOfBirth)
dict <- merge(dict,
              updated[, c("ids", "age")],
              by = "ids",
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE)
```


For subjects in the LIBDR, only the year of birth was extracted (not the whole
date) from NHS records to reduce the identifiability of subjects. This also
follows the [GDPR practice](https://gdpr-info.eu/) of only requesting data which
are strictly required.

The age at time of diagnosis has been calculated by subtracting the year of
birth from year of IBD diagnosis and is therefore not entirely accurate.
However, an error of within one year for age is reasonable for this study and
is expected to have a minimal impact on findings. 

Details for how time of diagnosis was obtained is described in a
[following section](#year-of-diagnosis).

#### Faecal calprotectin

```{R}
dict.fc <- subset(dict, ids %in% fcal$ids)

quants <- quantile(dict.fc$age, na.rm = TRUE, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) %>%
  data.frame()

quants <- cbind(rownames(quants), quants)
colnames(quants) <- c("Quantile", "Age at diagnosis")
```

In @fig-age-fc, we see IBD incidence by age similar to characterisations by
@Lewis2023, A bimodal distribution with a a large peak in the mid-20s and a
smaller peak in middle age. 

Age at diagnosis is missing for `r sum(is.na(dict.fc$age))`
(`r round(sum(is.na(dict.fc$age) / nrow(dict.fc) * 100), 2)`%) subjects in the
FC analysis. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-age-fc
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of age at diagnosis for subjects in the FC analysis."
dict.fc %>%
  filter(!is.na(age)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Density") +
  xlab("Age at diagnosis") +
  wrap_table(gt(quants), space = "free_y")  
```

#### CRP

```{R}
dict.crp <- subset(dict, ids %in% crp$ids)

quants <- quantile(dict.crp$age, na.rm = TRUE, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) %>%
  data.frame()

quants <- cbind(rownames(quants), quants)
colnames(quants) <- c("Quantile", "Age at diagnosis")
```


Age at diagnosis is missing for `r sum(is.na(dict.crp$age))`
(`r round(sum(is.na(dict.crp$age) / nrow(dict.crp) * 100), 2)`%) subjects 

```{R}
dict.crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_density(fill = "#EF2D56", color =  "#BE2544") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Density") +
  xlab("Age at diagnosis") +
  wrap_table(gt(quants), space = "free_y") 
```

### Sex

```{R}
dict <- fcal.all[, c("ids", "sex")] %>%
  distinct(ids,
           .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  merge(x = dict, by = "ids", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)


# Update NA sex if sex available from updated
dict <- merge(dict,
              updated[, c("ids", "sex")],
              by = "ids",
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE) 

for (i in 1:nrow(dict)){
  if (is.na(dict[i, "sex.x"]) & !is.na(dict[i, "sex.y"])) {
    dict[i, "sex.x"] <- dict[i, "sex.y"]
  }
}

dict$sex <- dict$sex.x
dict$sex.x <- dict$sex.y <- NULL

dict$sex <- plyr::mapvalues(dict$sex,
                            from = c("F", "M"),
                            to = c("Female", "Male"))
```

Similar to age, sex was obtained directly from health records. 

::: {.panel-tabset group="biomarker"}

#### Faecal calprotectin

Sex appears to be distributed evenly between females and males in the FC cohort.

```{R}
dict.fc <- subset(dict, ids %in% fcal$ids)
counts <- data.frame(table(dict.fc$sex))
colnames(counts) <- c("Sex", "Frequency")

dict.fc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Sex") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y")  
```

#### CRP

```{R}
dict.crp <- subset(dict, ids %in% crp$ids)
counts <- data.frame(table(dict.crp$sex))
colnames(counts) <- c("Sex", "Frequency")

dict.crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#EF2D56", color = "#BE2544") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Sex") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y")  
```

:::

### IBD type

```{R}
dict$diagnosis <- factor(dict$diagnosis,
                            levels = c("Crohn's Disease",
                                       "Ulcerative Colitis",
                                       "IBDU")
                            )
```

IBD type, defined as either either Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or
inflammatory bowel disease unclassified (IBDU), was identified using a
methodology previously described for the Lothian IBD Registry [@Jones2019].

::: {.panel-tabset group="biomarker"}

#### Faecal calprotectin

The majority of subjects in the FC analysis were diagnosed with Crohn's disease.

```{R}
dict.fc <- subset(dict, ids %in% fcal$ids)

counts <- data.frame(table(dict.fc$diagnosis))
colnames(counts) <- c("IBD type", "Frequency")

dict.fc %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = diagnosis)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("IBD type") +
    ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y")  
```

#### CRP

```{R}
dict.crp <- subset(dict, ids %in% crp$ids)

counts <- data.frame(table(dict.crp$diagnosis))
colnames(counts) <- c("IBD type", "Frequency")

dict.crp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = diagnosis)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#EF2D56", color = "#BE2544") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("IBD type") +
    ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y")  
```

### Year of diagnosis


```{R}
# Define eras
# 2005-2009, 2010-2014, 2015-2017
dict$era <- NA
dict <- 
  dict %>%
  mutate(era = if_else(year(date.of.diag) < 2010, "2005-2009", era)) %>%
  mutate(era = if_else(year(date.of.diag) > 2009 & year(date.of.diag) < 2015, "2010-2014", era)) %>%
  mutate(era = if_else(year(date.of.diag) > 2014 , "2015-2017", era))
```

Where possible, full dates for IBD diagnosis were extracted which were used to
determine if there were biomarker observations within Â± 90 days of diagnosis for
each subject in the LIBDR. Exact dates for some subjects were unavailable in
which case either the first day of the month, if month was available, or middle
of the year, if only year was available, was used. 

In addition to exploring individual years, we have also grouped years of
diagnosis into 'eras' to explore potential era effects. This will allow us to
explore if changes in clinical practice over time could have influenced cluster
trajectories. The following 'eras' are considered: 

* 2005--2009
* 2010--2014
* 2015--2017

::: {.panel-tabset group="biomarker"}

#### Faecal calprotectin

```{R}
dict.fc <- subset(dict, ids %in% fcal$ids)
dict.fc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year(date.of.diag))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year of diagnosis") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

We can observe the majority of subjects in the FC analysis were diagnosed
2010--2014 with relatively few subjects diagnosed 2005--2009. This may limit our
statistical power to detect era effects and is likely driven by there being
relatively few FC tests in this time. Indeed, this finding may reflect changes
in how FC has been used in clinical practice over time, transitioning from
being strictly used as a diagnostic tool to having a role in both diagnosis
and disease monitoring. 

```{R}
counts <- data.frame(table(dict.fc$era))
colnames(counts) <- c("Diagnosis era", "Frequency")

dict.fc %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = era)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Diagnosis era") +
    ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y") 
```

#### CRP

```{R}
dict.crp <- subset(dict, ids %in% crp$ids)
dict.crp %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year(date.of.diag))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "#EF2D56", color =   "#BE2544") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year of diagnosis") +
  ylab("Frequency")
```

```{R}
counts <- data.frame(table(dict.crp$era))
colnames(counts) <- c("Diagnosis era", "Frequency")

dict.crp %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = era)) +
    geom_bar(fill = "#EF2D56", color = "#BE2544") +
    theme_minimal() +
    xlab("Diagnosis era") +
    ylab("Frequency") +
  wrap_table(gt(counts), space = "free_y") 
```

### Biomarker at baseline

As a diagnostic observation was required for inclusion in the study, all study
subjects have a baseline biomarker observation available. After reducing the
biomarkers to only those meeting the study criteria, the first observation
with respect to time was used. Ties in first observation times, which may arise
from high-intensity monitoring in an inpatient setting, are not explicitly
handled. 

```{R}
temp <- fcal
temp <- temp[order(temp$calpro_time), ]

fc.ids <- unique(temp$ids)
fc.result <- c()

for (id in fc.ids) {
  fc.result <- c(fc.result, subset(temp, ids == id)[1, "calpro_result"])
} 

dict <- merge(dict, 
              data.frame(ids = fc.ids, baseline_fc = fc.result),
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE,
              by = "ids")


temp <- crp
temp <- temp[order(temp$crp_time), ]

crp.ids <- unique(temp$ids)
crp.result <- c()

for (id in crp.ids) {
  crp.result <- c(crp.result, subset(temp, ids == id)[1, "crp_result"])
} 

dict <- merge(dict, 
              data.frame(ids = crp.ids, baseline_crp = crp.result),
              all.x = TRUE,
              all.y = FALSE,
              by = "ids")
```

::: {.panel-tabset group="biomarker"}

#### Faecal calprotectin

```{R}
quants <- quantile(dict$baseline_fc,
                   na.rm = TRUE,
                   probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) %>%
  data.frame()
quants <- cbind(rownames(quants), round(quants, 2))
colnames(quants) <- c("Quantile", "Baseline FC")

dict %>%
  filter(!is.na(baseline_fc)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = baseline_fc)) +
  geom_density(fill = "#541388", color = "#2E294E") +

  xlab("Baseline FC") +

#### CRP

```{R}
quants <- quantile(dict$baseline_crp,
                   na.rm = TRUE,
                   probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) %>%
  data.frame()

quants <- cbind(rownames(quants), round(quants, 2))

## Demographics table

The following table compares the demographic data ("table 1") for the FC
and CRP analysis and the overlap between the two (subjects included in both
the FC and CRP analyses).

```{R}
dict.fc$model <- "FC"
dict.crp$model <- "CRP"
combined <- rbind(dict.fc, dict.crp)

both <- subset(dict.fc, ids %in% dict.crp$ids)
both$model <- "Overlap"
combined <- rbind(combined, both)
label(combined$age) <- "Age at diagnosis"
label(combined$sex) <- "Sex"
label(combined$diagnosis) <- "IBD type"

combined$model <- factor(combined$model, levels = c("FC", "CRP", "Overlap"))

my.render.cont <- function(x) {
  with(
    stats.apply.rounding(stats.default(x),
      digits = 3,
      round.integers = FALSE
    ),

  )
}
table1(~ age + sex + diagnosis | model,
  data = combined,
  overall = FALSE,
