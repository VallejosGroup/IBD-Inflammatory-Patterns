This page describes how the latent class mixed models (LCMMs) were fitted to 
faecal calprotectin (FC). [A separate page](crp.qmd) is dedicated to C-reactive
protein.

In order to not present subject-level data, subjects within each cluster have 
been collated into groups of six. 

## Model specification

LCMMs are an extension of linear mixed effects models with an added
cluster-specific fixed effect component. We use LCMMs with a natural cubic
spline formulation for the fixed effects component. Random effects are specified
as intercepts and the multinomial logistic regression model which assigns
cluster membership uses IBD type (CD, UC, or IBDU) as a covariate.

For full formal definitions of the models and statistics we have used in the
work, please refer to the supplementary material for our paper. 

### Model statistics 

## Model loading

Fitting the LCMMs discussed in this report takes multiple days in some cases and
uses 25 CPU cores per model. We have fitted these models using 
[Eddie](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing),
the University  of Edinburgh's high performance computing solution. The code in
the dropdown box below was used to fit the models.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon=false}

### Code used to fit models

::: {.panel-tabset}
{{< include fcal-m1.qmd >}}

{{< include fcal-lcmm.qmd >}}
:::

:::

As recommended by @Proust-Lima2017, a linear mixed effects model is first 
fitted to generate initial starting values, (the "Initial LME" tab). A
grid search approach is then used to converge the LCMMs towards a global maximum
for each assumed number of clusters based on maximum likelihood (the "LCMM"
tab). 

After the above code is run, the resultant models are saved in 
`cvallejo-predicct/libdr/cache/` for use in this report. 

When an LCMM is fitted, the assumed number of clusters (*or "classes"*) must be
specified a priori. Here we consider 4-8 clusters as 4 clusters were already
found in our previous work [@constantine-cooke2023], and we expect to find at
least as many clusters given our inclusion criteria is more relaxed.

A posteriori model statistics and visual investigations must be used to decide
upon the optimum number of classes.

## Fixed effects specified via Natural Cubic Splines

```{R Load NCS FCAL models}
# set the number of groups
G.fcal <- numeric()
models.fcal <- list()
G.cands <- seq(2, 10)
for (G.cand in G.cands) {
  file.name <- paste0(prefix, "/cache/fcal/ncs/fcal-", G.cand, ".RDS")
  if (file.exists(file.name)) {
    G.fcal <- c(G.fcal, G.cand)
    models.fcal[[G.cand]] <- readRDS(file.name)
  }
}
rm(G.cand)
```

We firstly consider specifying fixed effects using NCS which have a few notable
advantages [@Elhakeem2022]:

1. Less parameters need to be estimated than either a GRBF
   function regression model or a polynomial regression model with the same
   flexibility. This reduces the time complexity when fitting the model and in
   the future may also make extensions more practically feasible.
2. NCS enforce linearity between $t_0$ and the first knot and
   between the last knot and $t_\text{max}$ which ensures the model does not
   behave erratically in these sometimes problematic areas.
3. NCS are not highly sensitive to a continuous parameter and instead requires
   only $K$, the number of knots to be tuned. NCS are typically robust to where
   the knots themselves are placed.

### Knot choice

To determine the most appropriate number of knots for the natural cubic splines,
we considered two, three, and four knots. We only use six-cluster models for
this analysis as this reasonably captures heterogeneity without being too
expensive computationally.

Our previous work used three knots across a five-year period. As we are now
modelling across a seven-year period, we may need to increase the number of
knots to four to ensure the model remains flexible. We also considered two knots]
in case a more smoooth model is required.

We place the knots at their default location which is at quantiles. We note that
the number of knots is reported by @harrell2015 to be much more important than
knot location.

#### Model trajectories 

##### One knot

```{R}
#| label: fig-1-knots
#| fig-cap: "Cluster profiles for the six-cluster model assuming one knot. The vertical teal lines indicate knot location. Mean cluster profiles are denoted by the red curves"
knots.1 <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "/cache/fcal/ncs/1-knots.RDS"))
knots.1.list <- list()
knots.1.list[[6]] <- knots.1
cairo_pdf("paper/1-knots.pdf",
  width = 9,
  height = 9
)
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.1.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 1,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
invisible(dev.off())
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.1.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 1,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
```

##### Two knots

From @fig-2-knots, we can see specifying only two knots results in very smooth
curves for the mean trajectory of each cluster. However, this model appears
to be too smooth which results in a relatively poor fit. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-2-knots
#| fig-cap: "Cluster profiles for the six-cluster model assuming two knots. The vertical teal lines indicate knot location. Mean cluster profiles are denoted by the red curves"
knots.2 <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "/cache/fcal/ncs/2-knots.RDS"))
knots.2.list <- list()
knots.2.list[[6]] <- knots.2
cairo_pdf("paper/2-knots.pdf",
  width = 9,
  height = 9
)
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.2.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 2,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
invisible(dev.off())
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.2.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 2,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
```

##### Three knots

Three knots appears to be the most appropriate specification (@fig-3-knots).
Whilst there is  perhaps some evidence of overfitting, this appears to be
minimal. 

```{R}
#| label: fig-3-knots
#| fig-cap: "Cluster profiles for the six-cluster model assuming three knots. The vertical teal lines indicate knot location. Mean cluster profiles are denoted by the red curves"
knots.3 <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "cache/fcal/ncs/fcal-6.RDS"))
knots.3.list <- list()
knots.3.list[[6]] <- knots.3
cairo_pdf("paper/3-knots.pdf",
  width = 9,
  height = 9
)
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.3.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 3,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
invisible(dev.off())
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.3.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 3,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
```

##### Four knots

Four knots appears to be too many. @fig-4-knots presents a minor improvement to 
model fit over the three knot specification, and there are signs of overfitting
which is likely driven by the small distances between knots.  

```{R}
#| label: fig-4-knots
#| fig-cap: "Cluster profiles for the six-cluster model assuming four knots. The vertical teal lines indicate knot location. Mean cluster profiles are denoted by the red curves"
knots.4 <- readRDS(paste0(prefix, "/cache/fcal/ncs/4-knots.RDS"))
knots.4.list <- list()
knots.4.list[[6]] <- knots.4
cairo_pdf("paper/4-knots.pdf",
  width = 9,
  height = 9
)
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.4.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 4,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
invisible(dev.off())
spaghettiPlot(fcal,
  knots.4.list,
  G = 6,
  log = TRUE,
  tmax = 7,
  sizes = FALSE,
  knots = TRUE,
  n.knots = 4,
  var.time = "calpro_time"
)
```

#### Model statistics 

AIC and BIC both suggest a four-knot specification to be optimal
(@tbl-knot-stats-ncs). However, visual inspection of the mean cluster
trajectories ([see above](#model-trajectories)) suggests the four-knot approach
results in overfitting, especially around knot locations. This will also become
more of an issue as the number of clusters increase and additional sparsity is
exhibited for some clusters.

As such, we have elected to use natural cubic splines with three knots placed at 
quantiles. 

```{R}
#| results: "hold"
#| label: tbl-knot-stats-ncs
#| tbl-cap: Model statistics for differing numbers of knots for natural cubic splines
knots.df <- tibble(
  Knots = c("One knot", "Two knots", "Three knots", "Four knots"),
  loglik = c(
    knots.1$loglik,
    knots.2$loglik,
    knots.3$loglik,
    knots.4$loglik
  ),
  AIC = c(
    knots.1$AIC,
    knots.2$AIC,
    knots.3$AIC,
    knots.4$AIC
  ),
  BIC = c(
    knots.1$BIC,
    knots.2$BIC,
    knots.3$BIC,
    knots.4$BIC
  )
)
knitr::kable(knots.df,
  col.names = c(
    "Knots",
    "Maxmum log likelihood",
    "AIC",
    "BIC"
  )
)
rm(
  knots.1,
  knots.1.list,
  knots.3,
  knots.3.list,
  knots.4,
  knots.4.list
)
```

### Number of clusters

After determining the most appriopate number of knots, we must now decide upon
the most appropiate number of clusters.

From the alluvial plot comparing FC models (@fig-fcal-alluvial), we can see
newly formed clusters are quite robust- remaining consistent as the number of
clusters increases. However, new clusters are formed from multiple clusters
which implies these clusters do not have a high degree of separation from one
another. From  this figure, six clusters appear to be a reasonable choice.

#### IBD Association

For the cluster membership model, an IBDU or UC diagnosis for cluster 5 was
found to be statistically significant ($p = 0.01755$ and $p = 0.00645$
respectively). The coefficient for UC for cluster 4 was also
statistically different from zero (p = $0.00009$). For this comparison, cluster
6 was the reference cluster and CD was the reference level in for the diagnosis
factor.

#### Model metrics


```{R GRBF metrics plot}
#| label: fig-grbf-metrics
#| fig-cap: "Model metrics for FCAL for G = 2-8"
summaryplot(models.grbf[[2]],
  models.grbf[[3]],
  models.grbf[[4]],

  axis = "Class"
)
```

```{R grbf metrics table}
grbf.metrics <- makeMetrics(G.grbf, models.grbf)
buildDT(grbf.metrics)
```

The optimum AIC is <b>
`r format(sort(grbf.metrics[, 2])[1], scientific = FALSE)` </b> with cluster
`r order(grbf.metrics[,2])[1] + 3`. The optimum BIC is
<b>`r format(sort(grbf.metrics[, 3])[1], scientific = FALSE)` </b> with cluster
`r order(grbf.metrics[, 3])[1] + 3`
