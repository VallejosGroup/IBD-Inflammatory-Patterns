Also, all the designs used in ordinary linear regression can be used in this general setting. These designs include analysis of variance (ANOVAANOVA) setups, interaction effects, and nonlinear effects.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Management strategies and clinical outcomes vary substantially in patients newly diagnosed with Crohn's disease. We evaluated the use of a putative prognostic biomarker to guide therapy by assessing outcomes in patients randomised to either top-down (ie, early combined immunosuppression with infliximab and immunomodulator) or accelerated step-up (conventional) treatment strategies.
Methods
PROFILE (PRedicting Outcomes For Crohn's disease using a moLecular biomarker) was a multicentre, open-label, biomarker-stratified, randomised controlled trial that enrolled adults with newly diagnosed active Crohn's disease (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥7, either elevated C-reactive protein or faecal calprotectin or both, and endoscopic evidence of active inflammation). Potential participants had blood drawn to be tested for a prognostic biomarker derived from T-cell transcriptional signatures (PredictSURE-IBD assay). Following testing, patients were randomly assigned, via a secure online platform, to top-down or accelerated step-up treatment stratified by biomarker subgroup (IBDhi or IBDlo), endoscopic inflammation (mild, moderate, or severe), and extent (colonic or other). Blinding to biomarker status was maintained throughout the trial. The primary endpoint was sustained steroid-free and surgery-free remission to week 48. Remission was defined by a composite of symptoms and inflammatory markers at all visits. Flare required active symptoms (HBI ≥5) plus raised inflammatory markers (CRP >upper limit of normal or faecal calprotectin ≥200 μg/g, or both), while remission was the converse—ie, quiescent symptoms (HBI <5) or resolved inflammatory markers (both CRP ≤ the upper limit of normal and calprotectin <200 μg/g) or both. Analyses were done in the full analysis (intention-to-treat) population. The trial has completed and is registered (ISRCTN11808228).
Findings
Between Dec 29, 2017, and Jan 5, 2022, 386 patients (mean age 33·6 years [SD 13·2]; 179 [46%] female, 207 [54%] male) were randomised: 193 to the top-down group and 193 to the accelerated step-up group. Median time from diagnosis to trial enrolment was 12 days (range 0–191). Primary outcome data were available for 379 participants (189 in the top-down group; 190 in the accelerated step-up group). There was no biomarker–treatment interaction effect (absolute difference 1 percentage points, 95% CI –15 to 15; p=0·944). Sustained steroid-free and surgery-free remission was significantly more frequent in the top-down group than in the accelerated step-up group (149 [79%] of 189 patients vs 29 [15%] of 190 patients, absolute difference 64 percentage points, 95% CI 57 to 72; p<0·0001). There were fewer adverse events (including disease flares) and serious adverse events in the top-down group than in the accelerated step-up group (adverse events: 168 vs 315; serious adverse events: 15 vs 42), with fewer complications requiring abdominal surgery (one vs ten) and no difference in serious infections (three vs eight).
Interpretation
Top-down treatment with combination infliximab plus immunomodulator achieved substantially better outcomes at 1 year than accelerated step-up treatment. The biomarker did not show clinical utility. Top-down treatment should be considered standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed active Crohn's disease.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Most patients who have active Crohn's disease are treated initially with corticosteroids. Although this approach usually controls symptoms, many patients become resistant to or dependent on corticosteroids, and long exposure is associated with an increased risk of mortality. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of early use of combined immunosuppression with conventional management in patients with active Crohn's disease who had not previously received glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, or infliximab.
Methods
We did a 2-year open-label randomised trial at 18 centres in Belgium, Holland, and Germany between May, 2001, and January, 2004. We randomly assigned 133 patients to either early combined immunosuppression or conventional treatment. The 67 patients assigned to combined immunosuppression received three infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg of bodyweight) at weeks 0, 2, and 6, with azathioprine. We gave additional treatment with infliximab and, if necessary, corticosteroids, to control disease activity. 66 patients assigned to conventional management received corticosteroids, followed, in sequence, by azathioprine and infliximab. The primary outcome measures were remission without corticosteroids and without bowel resection at weeks 26 and 52. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00554710.
Findings
Four patients (two in each group) did not receive treatment as per protocol. At week 26, 39 (60·0%) of 65 patients in the combined immunosuppression group were in remission without corticosteroids and without surgical resection, compared with 23 (35·9%) of 64 controls, for an absolute difference of 24·1% (95% CI 7·3–40·8, p=0·0062). Corresponding rates at week 52 were 40/65 (61·5%) and 27/64 (42·2%) (absolute difference 19·3%, 95% CI 2·4–36·3, p=0·0278). 20 of the 65 patients (30·8%) in the early combined immunosuppression group had serious adverse events, compared with 19 of 64 (25·3%) controls (p=1·0).
Interpretation
Combined immunosuppression was more effective than conventional management for induction of remission and reduction of corticosteroid use in patients who had been recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Initiation of more intensive treatment early in the course of the disease could result in better outcomes.}
